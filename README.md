# OpenSecuritySMS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSecurityOrganization/OpenSecuritySMS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenSecurityOrganization/OpenSecuritySMS)

Thanks to OpenSecuritySMS you will text your friends in a secure way !

How does it work ?
------------------
It's easy !
<p>You need to have OpenSecuritySMS installed on the devices you want to chat with. A synchronization between your devices allow you to begin a new talk : everything is automated !</p>
<p>OpenSecuritySMS encrypts your text before sending them to your friends ! Once your friend receive the message he has to go in OpenSecuritySMS and it will decrypts it !</p>

Interested in helping us ?
